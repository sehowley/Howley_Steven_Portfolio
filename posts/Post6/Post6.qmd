## Path to Data Science {.smaller}

- Studied and graduated with a degree in Mathematics at Willamette University from 2018-2022.
- Always have had an interest in pure math, professors/mentors and coursework guided me to explore statistics where I gained an appreciation for modeling. 
-Coding was encouraged during this time, I found that I really like using R and have since gained proficiency in Python and SQL. 
-Choosing the path of data science seemed like a natural extension of what I had been studying as well as a way to express my creativity.
- Began a Masters of Data Science program in the summer of 2022 also at Willamette. Graduating August 2023.
- Providing insight gathered from evidence is what excites me the most about data science.
